      <h2 id="bio-heading">Biography</h2>
      <p>Born in Padoi (West Akoba, Jonglei State), <strong>Dak Dey Tut</strong> (also recorded as Dak Otong Tut and Dak Deth) studied in Khartoum in the early 1900s. He is recognized as the first South Sudanese (not only the first Nuer) to receive formal education. After returning, he played a pivotal role in naming Nuer sections and is credited with naming local institutions and terms including references to money, school, and the River Nile in the local discourse of the time.</p>

      <p>Dak Dey Tut publicly opposed British rule during Sudan's independence era and is remembered for asserting Nuer and South Sudanese identity. Historical records note that during his lifetime there were no recorded internal wars in his area. His documents were read by Sudanese Arab officials the night before the decision on South Sudan's independence. He died in the 1980s and was buried at his brother Gai Otoang's home in Padoi, prior to South Sudan's formal independence.</p>

      <h3>Notable anecdote</h3>
      <p class="meta">A recorded incident: Dak Dey Tut and Both Diu intentionally wore unmatched shoes and socks (one black shoe and one red shoe; Dak wore a black sock and a white sock). When asked by white officials why their footwear did not match, Both Diu asked whether any of the officials' shoes looked bad; when the officials answered yes, Dak stated that South Sudanese cannot match or stay together with Arabs. This incident is preserved here as part of his historical record.</p>
